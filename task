Balanced Smileys

Programming challenge description:

Credits: This problem appeared in the Facebook Hacker Cup 2013Hackathon.

Your friend John uses a lot of emoticons when you talk to him onMessenger. In addition to being a person who likes to expresshimself through emoticons, he hates unbalanced parenthesis so muchthat it makes him go :(.

Sometimes he puts emoticons within parentheses, and you find ithard to tell if a parenthesis really is a parenthesis or part of anemoticon. A message has balanced parentheses if it consists of oneof the following:

- An empty string ""
- One or more of the following characters: 'a' to 'z', ' ' (aspace) or ':' (a colon)
- An open parenthesis '(', followed by a message with balancedparentheses, followed by a close parenthesis ')'.
- A message with balanced parentheses followed by another messagewith balanced parentheses.
- A smiley face ":)" or a frowny face ":("

Write a program that determines if there is a way to interpret hismessage while leaving the parentheses balanced.

Input:

Your program should read lines from standard input. Each linecontains a message that you got from John.

Output:

Print out the string "YES"/"NO" (all quotes for clarity only)stating whether or not it is possible that the message had balancedparentheses

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

public class Main {
/**
* Iterate through each line of input.
*/
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
InputStreamReader reader = new InputStreamReader(System.in,StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(reader);
String line;
while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
  
System.out.println(line);
}
}
}
